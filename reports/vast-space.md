Exploring S and N space
================

Combinations of S & N
---------------------

These are the combinations of S and N I ran sampling on. There are three chunks: small, large S, and large N. Small is to get at behavior for very small S and N. Large S and large N explore larger communities in those directions. The bottom right corner is gently constrained because N must be &gt;= to S. I tried to explore the general regions of space filled by the datasets in the Baldridge/White papers. I've done this edges-approach because is computationally expensive to explore the large S-large N corner, and there aren't datasets there.

Number of unique elements (out of 10,000 draws)
-----------------------------------------------

I've drawn 10,000 times from the feasible set for each of these S-N combinations. For some of them, we won't be able to get 10,000 unique elements from the feasible set because the FS is in fact much smaller than that.

Shapes represented
------------------

-   Minimum, maximum skewness?
-   Range of skews? Sd of skews?
-   Other diversity indices? Constrain all of these by S.

Some sample heatmaps?
