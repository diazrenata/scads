```{r setup}
library(scads)
```

Choose an S and N and sample METE & the feasible set...

```{r choose s and n}
S = 4
N = 30
nsamples = 10
```

```{r sample FS}

fs_sims <- sample_feasibleset(s = S, n = N, nsamples = nsamples, distinct = TRUE)

```

```{r sample METE}

mete_sims <- sample_METE(s = S, n = N, nsamples = nsamples)

```
