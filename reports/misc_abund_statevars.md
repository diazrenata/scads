Exploring statevar space
================
10/7/2019

Downloading the data files used in Elita Baldridge's dissertation and White et al 2012, to see what the range of S and N in those data sets was.

Condit et al data: <https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.15146/R3MM4V> Condit, Richard et al. (2018), Tree species abundance through time in tropical forest census plots, Panama, DataONE, Dataset, <https://doi.org/10.15146/R3MM4V>

### Statevars

Broken out by site, BCI and Sherman (another of the Condit datasets) have *way* more individuals (and, by a smaller margin, species) than the other datasets. I think it may not be feasible to sample the BCI SADs. It may be possible to do Sherman (pending some trials on the hpg).

Broken out into the different sites - color is now *year*.

### Average abundance (N/S)
